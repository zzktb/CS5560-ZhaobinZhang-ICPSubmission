The SNPs mutational profiling showed enrichments of smoking-related signature 4 and defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR)-related signature 6 in younger patients, while the defective DNA MMR signature 26 was enriched among older patients. 
Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis was performed in order to explore functional effect of somatic alterations in relation to patient age. 
Extracellular Matrix-Receptor Interaction, Nucleotide Excision Repair and Axon Guidance seem crucial disrupted pathways in younger patients. 
We hypothesize that a higher sensitivity to smoking-related damages and the enrichment of defective DNA MMR related mutations may contribute to the higher mutational burden of younger patients. 
The two distinct age-related defective DNA MMR signatures 6 and 26 might be crucial mutational patterns in LUSC tumorigenesis which may develop distinct phenotypes. 
Our study provides indications of age-dependent differences in mutational backgrounds (SNPs and CNVs) as well as epigenetic patterns that might be relevant for age adjusted treatment approaches.
Surgical resection has traditionally been considered the standard of care for patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
With the introduction of stereotactic radiation body therapy (SBRT), there is now a viable option for medically inoperable patients with stage I NSCLC. 
The effectiveness of SBRT in patients with stage I disease but at elevated surgical risk is unknown. 
Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been attempted to compare surgical resection and SBRT in this population but have been aborted due to poor patient enrollment.
